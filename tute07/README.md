# Tutorial 07

## A. Finding Patterns

In groups, determine a possible pattern that could be used to solve each of the following problems:

- Sorting collections of records in different orders.
- Modelling a file system.
- Updating a UI component when the state of a program changes.
- Parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions.
- Adjusting the brightness of a screen based on a light sensor.

Then pick one and start to think about potential entities and draw up a rough UML diagram.

## B. Composite Pattern

Inside `src/calculator`, use the Composite Pattern to write a simple calculator that evaluates an expression. Your calculator should be able to:

- Add two expressions
- Subtract two expressions
- Multiply two expressions
- Divide two expressions

There should be a `Calculator` class as well which can be passed in an expression, and calculate that expression.

Design a solution, create stubs, write failing unit tests, then implement the functions.

## C. Factory Pattern

Inside `src/thrones`, there is some code to model a simple chess-like game. In this game different types of characters move around on a grid fighting each other. When one character moves into the square occupied by another they attack that character and inflict damage based on random chance. There are four types of characters:

- A king can move one square in any direction (including diagonally), and always causes 8 points of damage when attacking.
- A knight can move like a knight in chess (in an L shape), and has a 1 in 2 chance of inflicting 10 points of damage when attacking.
- A queen can move to any square in the same column, row or diagonal as she is currently on, and has a 1 in 3 chance of inflicting 12 points of damage or a 2 out of 3 chance of inflicting 6 points of damage.
- A troll can only move up, down, left or right, and has a 1 in 6 chance of inflicting 20 points of damage.

We won't concern ourselves with the logic of the game in this exercise per se, but instead the creation of objects.

We want to refactor the code so that when the characters are created, they are put in a random location in a grid of length 5.

1. How does the Factory Pattern (AKA Factory Method) allow us to abstract construction of objects, and how will it improve our design with this new requirement?

2. Use the Factory Pattern to create a series of object factories for each of the character types, and change the main method of Game.java to use these factories.
