# COMP2511 Tutorial

## How to use this

- To find the code written in your tutorial, change the branch on GitHub to your **class's code**.
- To find my generic solutions (that may differ to your class's solutions), change the branch to `solutions`.
- PDF versions of the slides should be located in the `slides` branch. If I have forgotten to upload them, please let me know via email.
- If you're desperate for the PDF slides, you can use my last term's slides [here](https://github.com/Kuroson/comp2511-T13B-22T3/tree/master/slides).
- Slides are found here [https://slides.com/kuroson](https://slides.com/kuroson).
