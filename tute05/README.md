# Tutorial 05

## A. Strategy Pattern

Inside `src/restaurant` is a solution for a restaurant payment system with the following requirements:

- The restaurant has a menu, stored in a JSON file. Each meal on the menu has a name and price
- The system displays all of the standard meal names and their prices to the user so they can make their order
- The user can enter their order as a series of meals, and the system returns their cost
- The prices on meals often vary in different circumstances. The restaurant has four different price settings:
  - Standard - normal rates
  - Holiday - 15% surcharge on all items for all customers
  - Happy Hour - where registered members get a 40% discount, while standard customers get 30%
  - Discount - where registered members get a 15% discount and standard customers pay normal prices
- The prices displayed on the menu are the ones for standard customers in all settings

Currently, the code uses switch statements to handle each of the different four cases.

- How does the code violate the open/closed principle?
- How does this make the code brittle?

Refactor the code to use the Strategy Pattern to handle the four settings.

Here is the strategy interface to get you started:

```java
public interface ChargingStrategy {

    /**
     * The cost of a meal.
     */
    public double cost(List<Meal> order, boolean payeeIsMember);

    /**
     * Modifying factor of charges for standard customers.
     */
    public double standardChargeModifier();

}
```

## B. Observer Pattern

In `src/youtube`, create a model for the following requirements of a Youtube-like video creating and watching service using the Observer Pattern:

- A Producer has a name, a series of subscribers and videos
- When a producer posts a new video, all of the subscribers are notified that a new video was posted
- A User has a name, and can subscribe to any Producer
- A video has a name, length and producer

Write a simple test with print statements inside `YoutubeTest.java`.

Once this is done, think about what if we want to be able to produce videos and subscribe to videos as well (the way youtube actually works). In groups, draw a UML diagram refactoring the code so that the `Producer` and `User` classes are merged, whilst still using the Observer Pattern.

## C. State Pattern

This exercise continues on from Exercise B.

Extend your solution to accomodate the following requirements:

- Users can view a video, and a viewing has a series of states:
  - Playing state - the video is playing
  - Ready state - the video is paused, ready to play
  - Locked state - the video is temporarily 'locked' from being watched

The actions and state transitions are as follows:

| State   | Locking                                    | Playing                                      | Next                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Locked  | If playing, switch to Ready State          | Switch to Ready State                        | Return Error: Locked                                           |
| Playing | Stops playing and switches to Locked State | Pauses video and switches to Ready State     | Starts playing the next video                                  |
| Ready   | Changes to locked state                    | Starts playback and changes to playing state | Returns Error: Locked (cannot move to next video while paused) |
